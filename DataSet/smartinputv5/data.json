Shanghai ChuLe (CooTek) Information Technology Co., Ltd. (\"We\") and applies to TouchPal Keyboard, including our mobile apps and other various cloud-based services. It is very important for you to understand what kind of data we collect and how we use them.

Data that we collect or record: We will collect information concerning the words and phrases that you input (e.g. an input sequence, the application's name which TouchPal Keyboard is applied in, a selected candidate word/phrase, words/phrases added to the dictionary) and import them into your own user dictionary. We will learn and collect your own wording from your input text messages (SMS or MMS), to help us provide you a faster and more precise prediction (including the popup smiley prediction). We will collect and import your contact names into your own user dictionary, so that you can type your contact names faster. We will collect your SMS and the content published on Twitter and Facebook for customized prediction, and we just collect such information or content for learning purpose and it will not be uploaded to our server.

We will collect location information (e.g. Locale data, IP data, GPS information) to assist us to orientate the region or country that you are located. Then we can improve the prediction with different trends words according to different location, and to provide you with relevant location-based services, such as local weather information and POI (point of interest) and personalized contents and services. We will also collect your usage information of relevant apps on your mobile phone, so that we can optimize the use experience of TouchPal Keyboard.
