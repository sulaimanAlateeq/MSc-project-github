We endeavor to make sure the Service's functionality puts you on reasonable notice as to the scope of an intended submission.  In addition, we may automatically receive and store certain, anonymous types of information whenever you interact with the Service. Such information may include the user's IP address, domain server, and type of Internet browser. This information helps us, among other things, analyze trends and administer the Service. This information is anonymous and contains no personally identifiable data.  Do Not Track Policy. Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.

Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.  4.

us that explains what data we collect, how we store and transfer it, and how we use it. We encourage you to read this privacy policy carefully when using our application or services. By using our application or other online services, you are accepting this privacy policy.  When we post changes to this privacy policy, we will revise the last updated date on the top of this privacy policy. We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically.  Why do we collect data? We collect, store and use your data in order to operate our business and to provide our products and services to you.  We may use information we collect about you to:  Deliver, improve, debug, and maintain our products and services, including future products and services Study and personalize user experiences Perform analysis about your use of, or interest in, our or others\u2019 products, services, or content, including mobile analytics Develop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our service and other sites, including providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites Fulfill legal requirements Conduct business analysis and research, and marketing campaigns Ensure better security and fraud protection Perform functions or services described to you at the time of collection We may also use your information regarding updates, upgrades, enhancements, surveys, recommendations and/or advertisements, if we believe these are relevant for you.  What data do\u2028 we collect? In normal browsing mode, the Cake browser may store your browsing history (URLs of pages that you visit, your IP address, a cache of text, images and other resources from those pages) on your local device, in an anonymous fashion that is not tied to your identity. The Cake browser gives you the option to store on your local device in an encrypted fashion your usernames and passwords (to help fill out forms or sign in to sites you visit). The Cake browser also stores on your local device a list of permissions you have granted to sites, cookies or data from sites you visit, and a record of what you downloaded from websites. We may collect browsing information (URLs of pages visited and IP addresses) in an anonymous fashion that is not tied to your identity. When you are in Privacy Mode, Cake does not collect your anonymous browsing history information and deletes any cookies or other downloaded information when you close any tabs that were opened in Privacy Mode. See How Does Cake Privacy Mode Work below for more information.  You can manage your information in the Cake browser. At any time, you can delete your browsing history (URLs of pages that you visit, a cache of text, images and other resources from those pages) and remove any cookies or other site data stored on your device.  Personal Information means individually identifiable information that would allow us to determine the actual identity of and contact, a specific living person. We may collect Personal Information in the future through our services and products. We may also collect your geo-location information in the future, but with your consent.  How do we collect data? Generally, we collect data:  When you provide it to us; for example, when you submit a form on our applications When you install and run our products or use our services, we use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities using our services When third parties share information with us Some products may require your Personal Information to function properly. You don't have to grant any app permissions to us in order to use the Cake browser. We may ask for app permissions (for example, we may ask to send you push notifications or for location information) in order to enhance your experience, but you can choose whether or not to grant those permissions.  When we collect your data, we associate it with a unique ID and a unique device ID that are generated when you install a Cake product or begin using our services. These identifiers are anonymized. Analytics companies use unique IDs to track information about app usage.  We use advertising IDs such as Apple\u2019s Advertising Identifier. Unlike cookies, these IDs cannot be deleted, but advertising IDs can be reset in Settings on your iOS device. Ad companies also use advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are relevant to you.  We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements on our service. These companies may use tracking technologies to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org). Opting out will not decrease the number of advertisements you see. To opt-out of cookies that may be set by third party data or advertising partners, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.  This privacy policy does not cover third-party apps and services you access and use through our products and services, nor does it cover links to other websites. We do not control the privacy and security practices and policies of these third parties and their sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of the third-party apps and websites you use. We are not responsible for security practices and policies of third party apps and sites and you agree to release and waive any claim against us as a result of your use of third party apps and sites.  How does Cake\u2019s Privacy Mode work? When you use Cakes Privacy Mode, the Cake browser ignores your existing cookies and does not record your browsing history. When you close any tabs that were opened in Privacy Mode, any cookies generated as well as any web page, text or pictures viewed in Privacy Mode are deleted from your device. It is important to understand that using Privacy Mode does not hide your browsing activities from your internet service provider or from your employer (if you are using their network).  How do we protect your data? While we will take commercially reasonable security measures to help safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to protect your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your information (including Personal Information) will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their Personal Information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.  Our commitment to your privacy does not extend to third-party products and services you may access from Cake products and services. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of the third-party products and services you use. You use any third-party products and services at your own risk. You further waive and release us from any claim arising from your use of third-party products and services.  How do we share your data?
