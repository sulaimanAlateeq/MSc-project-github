information\u2019 (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.  What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?  When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address or other details to help you with your experience.  When do we collect information?  We collect information from you when you register on our site or enter information on our site.  How do we use your information?  We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:  \u2022 To personalize users experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested. \u2022 To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests. \u2022 To quickly process your transactions. \u2022 To send periodic emails regarding your order or other products and services.  How do we protect visitor information?  We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards. We do not use Malware Scanning.  Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.  We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.  All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.  Do we use \u2018cookies\u2019?  We do not use cookies for tracking purposes. However, some third-party services (e.g. Google Analytics) might use cookies to gather information about people using our sites and apps.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browsers Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  Third Party Disclosure  We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others\u2019 rights, property, or safety.  However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.  Third party links  We do not include or offer third party products or services on our website.  California Online Privacy Protection Act  CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law\u2019s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. \u2013 See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf  According to CalOPPA we agree to the following: Users can visit our site anonymously Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word \u2018Privacy\u2019, and can be easily be found on the page specified above.  Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes: \u2022 On our Privacy Policy Page Users are able to change their personal information: \u2022 By emailing us \u2022 By chatting with us or sending us a ticket  How does our site handle do not track signals? We don\u2019t honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. We don\u2019t honor them because: It is an app  Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking? It\u2019s also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking  COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)  When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation\u2019s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children\u2019s privacy and safety online.  We do not specifically market to children under 13.  Fair Information Practices  The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.  In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify the users via email \u2022 Within 7 business days We will notify the users via in site notification \u2022 Within 7 business days  We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.  CAN SPAM Act  The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.  We collect your email address in order to: \u2022 Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions. \u2022 Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred  To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following: \u2022 NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses \u2022 Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way \u2022 Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters \u2022 Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used. \u2022 Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly \u2022 Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email  If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can \u2022 Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email. and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
