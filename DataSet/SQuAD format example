				"context": "1. Brilliant.org Privacy Statement Brilliant Worldwide, Inc. (\"Brilliant\") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Statement. By using the brilliant.org website, or any of our mobile applications (such as are available via the App Store and Google Play Store), and any related services and/or features (collectively, the \"Service\") you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Statement. If you are a resident of the European Union (\"EU\"), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") with respect to your Personal Information, as outlined below.  2. What Does This Privacy Statement Cover? This Privacy Statement covers Brilliant's treatment of personally identifiable information (\"Personal Information\") that Brilliant gathers when you access/use the Service.  3. What Personal Information Does Brilliant Collect? Brilliant collects information you voluntarily submit to the Service, such as, the information we collect when you register for an account: your name, email address, school, date of birth, etc.  Information you elect to submit to the Service in a public or quasi-public manner may be disclosed to other users of the Application or the general public (\"User Submission(s)\"). For example if you make a post to a message board or chat forum that includes any personal information   such information will be made publicly available. We endeavor to make sure the Service's functionality puts you on reasonable notice as to the scope of an intended submission.  In addition, we may automatically receive and store certain, anonymous types of information whenever you interact with the Service. Such information may include the user's IP address, domain server, and type of Internet browser. This information helps us, among other things, analyze trends and administer the Service. This information is anonymous and contains no personally identifiable data.  Do Not Track Policy. Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a \"Do Not Track\" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.  4. What about children? The safety and privacy of children is extremely important to us. If you are a resident of the EU, United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, then you must be 16 years old or older to use the Services in any way. Otherwise, every user of the Service must be 13 years of age or older. Any person that does not meet the foregoing age requirements is a \"Minor\". Minors are prohibited from signing up or using the Service in any way. If you are a Minor, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a Minor, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a Minor may have provided us personal information, please contact us at privacy@brilliant.org. We reserve the right to require any user to verify that the user is not a Minor, and if a user does not provide such verification in a timely manner, we will terminate the user's account and delete all personally identifiable information displaying on the site and collected from such user.  5. How does Brilliant use the information it collects? Provide the Service: Your information will be used primarily to provide you with the Service. Improve the Service: Your information may be used by us internally to improve the Service and develop new products, services and features. Other Uses: Your information may also be used by us as set forth in the next section. 6. Will Brilliant Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives? To the limited extent we collect Personal Information  we neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below.  Recipient of User Submissions: As mentioned above   your User Submissions may be shared in a public or quasi-public manner.  Service Providers and Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf. For example, we may decide to use a third party payment processing company to process payments you make through the Service. In addition, parts of the Service may be hosted by a third party on our behalf. Your information may be accessed by such providers/agents, in the event that we need to share your information with them to provide our services or customer support to you. Unless we tell you differently, Brilliant's agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.  Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Brilliant, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Brilliant goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Brilliant may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.  Protection of Brilliant and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Brilliant, our employees, our users, or others.  With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.  7. Conditions of Use If you decide to access or use the Service, such access and use and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Statement and our Terms of Use (located on our website), including limitations on damages, disclaimer of warranties, and the application of California state law.  8. Third Party Websites/Services The Site may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Site. These other websites are not under Brilliant control, and such links do not constitute an endorsement by Brilliant of those other websites or the services offered through them. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the Service are not covered by this Privacy Statement, and Brilliant is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.  9. Opting out of all future emails If you would like to stop receiving email from Brilliant, simply visit the Email section of your Account settings and uncheck any and all boxes.  10.

California Privacy Rights If you are a California resident please click here to learn more about your privacy rights.  12. GDPR For this GDPR section, we use the terms \"Personal Data\" and \"processing\" as they are defined in the GDPR, but \"Personal Data\" generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and \"processing\" generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.

What data do we collect? In normal browsing mode, the Cake browser may store your browsing history (URLs of pages that you visit, your IP address, a cache of text, images and other resources from those pages) on your local device, in an anonymous fashion that is not tied to your identity. The Cake browser gives you the option to store on your local device in an encrypted fashion your usernames and passwords (to help fill out forms or sign in to sites you visit). The Cake browser also stores on your local device a list of permissions you have granted to sites, cookies or data from sites you visit, and a record of what you downloaded from websites. We may collect browsing information (URLs of pages visited and IP addresses) in an anonymous fashion that is not tied to your identity. When you are in Privacy Mode, Cake does not collect your anonymous browsing history information and deletes any cookies or other downloaded information when you close any tabs that were opened in Privacy Mode. See How Does Cake Privacy Mode Work below for more information.  You can manage your information in the Cake browser. At any time, you can delete your browsing history (URLs of pages that you visit, a cache of text, images and other resources from those pages) and remove any cookies or other site data stored on your device.  Personal Information means individually identifiable information that would allow us to determine the actual identity of and contact, a specific living person. We may collect Personal Information in the future through our services and products. We may also collect your geo-location information in the future, but with your consent.  How do we collect data? Generally, we collect data:  When you provide it to us; for example, when you submit a form on our applications When you install and run our products or use our services, we use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities using our services When third parties share information with us Some products may require your Personal Information to function properly. You don't have to grant any app permissions to us in order to use the Cake browser. We may ask for app permissions (for example, we may ask to send you push notifications or for location information) in order to enhance your experience, but you can choose whether or not to grant those permissions.  When we collect your data, we associate it with a unique ID and a unique device ID that are generated when you install a Cake product or begin using our services. These identifiers are anonymized. Analytics companies use unique IDs to track information about app usage.  We use advertising IDs such as Apples Advertising Identifier. Unlike cookies, these IDs cannot be deleted, but advertising IDs can be reset in Settings on your iOS device. Ad companies also use advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are relevant to you.  We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements on our service. These companies may use tracking technologies to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org). Opting out will not decrease the number of advertisements you see. To opt-out of cookies that may be set by third party data or advertising partners, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.  This privacy policy does not cover third-party apps and services you access and use through our products and services, nor does it cover links to other websites. We do not control the privacy and security practices and policies of these third parties and their sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of the third-party apps and websites you use. We are not responsible for security practices and policies of third party apps and sites and you agree to release and waive any claim against us as a result of your use of third party apps and sites.  How does Cakes Privacy Mode work? When you use Cakes Privacy Mode, the Cake browser ignores your existing cookies and does not record your browsing history. When you close any tabs that were opened in Privacy Mode, any cookies generated as well as any web page, text or pictures viewed in Privacy Mode are deleted from your device. It is important to understand that using Privacy Mode does not hide your browsing activities from your internet service provider or from your employer (if you are using their network).  How do we protect your data? While we will take commercially reasonable security measures to help safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to protect your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your information (including Personal Information) will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their Personal Information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.  Our commitment to your privacy does not extend to third-party products and services you may access from Cake products and services. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of the third-party products and services you use. You use any third-party products and services at your own risk. You further waive and release us from any claim arising from your use of third-party products and services.  How do we share your data? We may use and share non-Personal Information to the extent allowed by law. If we collect Personal Information, we will not provide non-masked or non-obscured Personal Information to third parties, except:  To government bodies and law enforcement agencies to comply with the law, for example in judicial proceedings, by court order or other legal process To third parties (including professional advisors) to enforce or defend our legal rights, including our terms and conditions, and investigate violations thereof To a third-party purchaser or seller (including professional advisors) in connection with a corporate event such as a merger, business acquisition or insolvency situation To any person as required by law As described elsewhere in this statement We may use any information internally for the reasons set forth under Why Do We Collect Data above. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis, advertising, marketing, or other business purposes.  What else should I know?   We keep your information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable legal requirements. If you cease usage of the Cake browser, we will retain certain data for analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, enforce our Terms of Service & License Agreement, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our service, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties policies.  Onward transfer and consent to international processing We are a growing corporation with users and operations in multiple countries, including the European Union. We have developed data practices designed to assure information is appropriately protected but we cannot always know where information may be accessed or processed. While our primary data centers are in the United States, we may transfer Personal Information or other information to locations outside of the United States. In addition, we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf outside of the United States, and we will seek commercially reasonable assurances that any information we may provide to them is safeguarded adequately and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the requirements of applicable privacy laws.  If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal data by us from your region to countries which do not have data protection laws that provide the same level of protection that exists in countries in the European Economic Area, including the United States.
