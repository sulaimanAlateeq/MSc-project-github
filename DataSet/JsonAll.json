In addition, we may automatically receive and store certain, anonymous types of information whenever you interact with the Service. Such information may include the user's IP address, domain server, and type of Internet browser. This information helps us, among other things, analyze trends and administer the Service. This information is anonymous and contains no personally identifiable data.  Do Not Track Policy. Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.

Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.  4.

us that explains what data we collect, how we store and transfer it, and how we use it. We encourage you to read this privacy policy carefully when using our application or services. By using our application or other online services, you are accepting this privacy policy.  When we post changes to this privacy policy, we will revise the last updated date on the top of this privacy policy. We encourage you to review this privacy policy periodically.  Why do we collect data? We collect, store and use your data in order to operate our business and to provide our products and services to you.  We may use information we collect about you to:  Deliver, improve, debug, and maintain our products and services, including future products and services Study and personalize user experiences Perform analysis about your use of, or interest in, our or others\u2019 products, services, or content, including mobile analytics Develop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your interests on our service and other sites, including providing our advertisements to you when you visit other sites Fulfill legal requirements Conduct business analysis and research, and marketing campaigns Ensure better security and fraud protection Perform functions or services described to you at the time of collection We may also use your information regarding updates, upgrades, enhancements, surveys, recommendations and/or advertisements, if we believe these are relevant for you.  What data do\u2028 we collect? In normal browsing mode, the Cake browser may store your browsing history (URLs of pages that you visit, your IP address, a cache of text, images and other resources from those pages) on your local device, in an anonymous fashion that is not tied to your identity. The Cake browser gives you the option to store on your local device in an encrypted fashion your usernames and passwords (to help fill out forms or sign in to sites you visit). The Cake browser also stores on your local device a list of permissions you have granted to sites, cookies or data from sites you visit, and a record of what you downloaded from websites. We may collect browsing information (URLs of pages visited and IP addresses) in an anonymous fashion that is not tied to your identity. When you are in Privacy Mode, Cake does not collect your anonymous browsing history information and deletes any cookies or other downloaded information when you close any tabs that were opened in Privacy Mode. See How Does Cake Privacy Mode Work below for more information.  You can manage your information in the Cake browser. At any time, you can delete your browsing history (URLs of pages that you visit, a cache of text, images and other resources from those pages) and remove any cookies or other site data stored on your device.  Personal Information means individually identifiable information that would allow us to determine the actual identity of and contact, a specific living person. We may collect Personal Information in the future through our services and products. We may also collect your geo-location information in the future, but with your consent.  How do we collect data? Generally, we collect data:  When you provide it to us; for example, when you submit a form on our applications When you install and run our products or use our services, we use various technologies to collect information from your device and about your activities using our services When third parties share information with us Some products may require your Personal Information to function properly. You don't have to grant any app permissions to us in order to use the Cake browser. We may ask for app permissions (for example, we may ask to send you push notifications or for location information) in order to enhance your experience, but you can choose whether or not to grant those permissions.  When we collect your data, we associate it with a unique ID and a unique device ID that are generated when you install a Cake product or begin using our services. These identifiers are anonymized. Analytics companies use unique IDs to track information about app usage.  We use advertising IDs such as Apple\u2019s Advertising Identifier. Unlike cookies, these IDs cannot be deleted, but advertising IDs can be reset in Settings on your iOS device. Ad companies also use advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance and display ads that are relevant to you.  We may allow service providers, advertising companies and ad networks, and other third parties to display advertisements on our service. These companies may use tracking technologies to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. Some of these third-party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies (www.networkadvertising.org). Opting out will not decrease the number of advertisements you see. To opt-out of cookies that may be set by third party data or advertising partners, please go to http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.  This privacy policy does not cover third-party apps and services you access and use through our products and services, nor does it cover links to other websites. We do not control the privacy and security practices and policies of these third parties and their sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of the third-party apps and websites you use. We are not responsible for security practices and policies of third party apps and sites and you agree to release and waive any claim against us as a result of your use of third party apps and sites.  How does Cake\u2019s Privacy Mode work? When you use Cakes Privacy Mode, the Cake browser ignores your existing cookies and does not record your browsing history. When you close any tabs that were opened in Privacy Mode, any cookies generated as well as any web page, text or pictures viewed in Privacy Mode are deleted from your device. It is important to understand that using Privacy Mode does not hide your browsing activities from your internet service provider or from your employer (if you are using their network).  How do we protect your data? While we will take commercially reasonable security measures to help safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to protect your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your information (including Personal Information) will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their Personal Information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.  Our commitment to your privacy does not extend to third-party products and services you may access from Cake products and services. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of the third-party products and services you use. You use any third-party products and services at your own risk. You further waive and release us from any claim arising from your use of third-party products and services.  How do we share your data?

"Privacy Policy This privacy policy was last modified on December 29, 2008.  Recent updates to this Privacy Policy Goodreads, Inc. (\"Goodreads,\" \"we,\" or \"us\") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Goodreads when you use Goodreads.com (the \"site\") and related services (the Service), how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  Information We Collect User-Provided Information: You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, when you register with the Service. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. In addition, you may choose to add information about yourself to your profile that you can then share with friends. You can modify, delete, and set your privacy setting for this information any time in the My Account section of the site after you have signed in using your personal password.  Cookies Information: When you visit Goodreads.com, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Goodreads help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. Goodreads uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser\u2019s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.  Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.  Clear Gifs Information: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your Goodreads account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Goodreads better for our users.  How We Use Your Information We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. Goodreads never discloses your personal information to any third party unless you have instructed us to do so.  Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service (for instance, in User Content you post) becomes available to the public via the Service and our business partners. User Content includes, but is not limited to, reviews, comments, and trivia questions. If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.  Goodreads takes reasonable measures to keep messages that you send to other Members through the Service private between you and the recipient. However, even if you have deleted the message from your Goodreads inbox or outbox, copies of the message may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored the message.  By providing Goodreads your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters, changes to features of the Service, or special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by changing your settings on the My Account page. Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.  Your name and, depending on privacy settings, email address, are used when you invite another person to join Goodreads, or when a you request to add another member to your friends list.  Goodreads may use certain information about you and/or your User Content without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and personalizing advertisements and promotions.  Goodreads may develop special sites in cooperation with other companies. If you register at these \"co-branded\" sites, we may share your registration information (such as name and email address) with that company.  Goodreads reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the site. Goodreads has the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation, if in its sole opinion, such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement or to protect or defend its rights or property or those of any third party. Goodreads also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.  We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.  How We Share Your Information Personally Identifiable Information: Goodreads will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others. Goodreads may share your personally identifiable information with third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this, such third parties\u2019 use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Goodreads (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).  As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.  Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Goodreads will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Goodreads, our users or others.  Non-Personally Identifiable Information: We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Goodreads services.  Goodreads allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements on the Goodreads site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on Goodreads. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.  Goodreads does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Goodreads to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.  You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. The Goodreads privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers.  How We Protect Your Information Goodreads uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Goodreads and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Goodreads makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.  To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Goodreads, at all times.  Compromise of Personal Information In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Goodreads will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.  Your Choices About Your Information You may access or change your information and preferences at any time in your My Account area once you have signed in with your personal password. For example, you can control which actions, if any, will appear on your update feed, whether to display your email address, whether to display your last name, and what sort of email notifications you will receive from the Service. You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through Goodreads, in which case Goodreads may not be able to provide certain services to you.  Children's Privacy Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Goodreads does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Goodreads. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us.  Links to Other Web Sites We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including those that have a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.  Notification Procedures It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our Website page, as determined by Goodreads in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.  Changes to Our Privacy Policy If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

with how their \u2018Personally identifiable information\u2019 (PII) is being used online. PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.  What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?  When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address or other details to help you with your experience.  When do we collect information?  We collect information from you when you register on our site or enter information on our site.  How do we use your information?  We may use the information we collect from you when you register, make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:  \u2022 To personalize users experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product offerings in which you are most interested. \u2022 To allow us to better service you in responding to your customer service requests. \u2022 To quickly process your transactions. \u2022 To send periodic emails regarding your order or other products and services.  How do we protect visitor information?  We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards. We do not use Malware Scanning.  Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.  We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.  All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.  Do we use \u2018cookies\u2019?  We do not use cookies for tracking purposes. However, some third-party services (e.g. Google Analytics) might use cookies to gather information about people using our sites and apps.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browsers Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  Third Party Disclosure  We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others\u2019 rights, property, or safety.  However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.  Third party links  We do not include or offer third party products or services on our website.  California Online Privacy Protection Act  CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law\u2019s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. \u2013 See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf  According to CalOPPA we agree to the following: Users can visit our site anonymously Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page, or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word \u2018Privacy\u2019, and can be easily be found on the page specified above.  Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes: \u2022 On our Privacy Policy Page Users are able to change their personal information: \u2022 By emailing us \u2022 By chatting with us or sending us a ticket  How does our site handle do not track signals? We don\u2019t honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place. We don\u2019t honor them because: It is an app  Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking? It\u2019s also important to note that we do not allow third party behavioral tracking  COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)  When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation\u2019s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children\u2019s privacy and safety online.  We do not specifically market to children under 13.  Fair Information Practices  The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.  In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur: We will notify the users via email \u2022 Within 7 business days We will notify the users via in site notification \u2022 Within 7 business days  We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.  CAN SPAM Act  The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.  We collect your email address in order to: \u2022 Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions. \u2022 Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred  To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following: \u2022 NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses \u2022 Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way \u2022 Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters \u2022 Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used. \u2022 Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly \u2022 Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email  If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can \u2022 Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email. and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.

February 8, 2018. To see what has changed click here.  IMDb knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. By visiting IMDb, or by visiting other properties operated by IMDb such as IMDbPro, Withoutabox, Box Office Mojo, and DPReview.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.  What Personal Information About Users Does IMDb Gather?  The information we learn from users helps us personalize and continually improve your experience at IMDb. Here are the types of information we gather.  Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future browsing for you, improving our site, and communicating with you. Automatic Information: We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use \"cookies,\" and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses IMDb or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of IMDb on other Web sites. Click here to see examples of the information we receive. E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from IMDb if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please use our User Administration pages to adjust your preferences. Mobile: When you download or use apps created by IMDb, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, local show times, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. For more information about how to do this, click here. Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Click here to see examples of the information we receive. What About Cookies?  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as Watchlist, local show times, and browsing preferences. The \"help\" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of IMDb's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. We use web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs) and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of certain site features and to conduct research and analysis. We also allow third parties to place web beacons and other technologies on our site to conduct research and analysis, but we do not provide personal information to such third parties. Does IMDb Share the Information It Receives?  Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share user information with our parent corporation (Amazon.com, Inc.), the subsidiaries it controls, and as described below.  Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases, we will include offerings from these businesses on IMDb. In other cases, we may include joint offerings from IMDb and these businesses on IMDb. You can tell when another business is involved in the offering, and we share user information related to those offerings with that business. Agents: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from user lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing assistance. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of IMDb users on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and e-mail address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please use our User Administration pages to adjust your preferences. Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy additional services or business units. In such transactions, user information generally is transferred along with the rest of the service or business unit. Also, in the event that IMDb.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will of course be included in the transaction. Protection of IMDb and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of IMDb, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will always receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. What About Third-Party Advertisers?  Our site includes third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites.  These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or \"serve\") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Notice. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called \"ad networks\" or \"network advertisers\"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.  IMDb also displays personalized third-party advertising based on personal information about users, such as information you submit to us about movies you own or have watched.  Click here for more information about the personal information that we gather. Although IMDb does not provide any personal information to advertisers, advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized advertisement meet their criteria to personalize the ad (for example, users in the northwestern United States who bought, watched, or browsed for romantic comedies). If you do not want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize advertisements we display to you, please adjust your Advertising Preferences.  How Secure Is Information About Me?  If you use our subscription service, we work to protect the security of your subscription information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.  It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.  What Choices and Access Do I Have?  As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to take advantage of such IMDb features as My Movies and local show times. You can add or update certain information, such as your e-mail address, by using our User Administration pages. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please use our User Administration pages to adjust your preferences. (If you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of IMDb, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.) If you do not want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize advertisements we display to you, please adjust your Advertising Preferences. The \"help\" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of IMDb's essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. Children  IMDb is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you may not submit information about yourself to IMDb.  Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions  If you choose to visit IMDb, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our Terms and Conditions of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the state of Washington.  If you have any concern about privacy at IMDb, please send us a thorough description to our customer service team, and we will try to resolve it.  Our business changes constantly. This Notice and the Terms and Conditions of Use will change also, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Notice in effect at the time of use. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account.  We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.  Examples of Information Collected Information You Give Us: You provide most such information when you register, search, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with us. For example, you provide information when you search for a movie, actor or director; provide information in our registration form; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; vote in a poll; provide movie reviews or information related to movies; participate in a discussion board; and employ our notification services. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, e-mail address, physical address, zip code, and phone number; your age and gender; the movies and actors you like or dislike; and your general movie preferences.  Automatic Information: Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history; the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; and pages you viewed or searched for. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our Web site for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.  Information from Other Sources: Examples of information we receive from other sources include updated delivery and address information so that we can correct our records and deliver your next communication more easily.", "document_id": 7}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "what information are you collecting from me?", "id": 1900001, "answers": [{"text": "If you create an account on

To control the information that you share, you have the option of modifying your Khan Academy or social network settings or disconnecting your social network account from your Khan Academy account. We may share data with third-party applications that you authorize. Third-party application developers and service providers (commonly known as App Developers) may build complementary services for our platform, such as a mobile application for visually-impaired learners to access our resources, or may use our Khan Academy content to build unaffiliated applications and services. If you connect your Khan Academy account to an application or service, or approve access to your Khan Academy account by a third party application or service, you consent to Khan Academy sharing your information with that third party. We may share data in connection with special programs you participate in. If you participate in special programs where Khan Academy partners with third parties, Khan Academy may share data collected from or about you with its third party partners to facilitate the program or services being offered. For instance, if you participate in Khan Academy's program with College Board, Khan Academy may share information regarding your study habits, tests taken, and test scores with College Board. These program partners may use your information we share with them as described in their own privacy policies. We may share information with your consent. Khan Academy does not share your Personal Information with third-party organizations for their marketing or promotional use without your consent. In some instances, you may be able to grant us permission to share your Personal Information with authorized partners, not-for-profit organizations, and other entities that are not affiliated with Khan Academy. In these cases, we will only provide to these third parties the information you have authorized or asked us to share to these third parties. You may also choose to share content with others by email, or by posting Khan Academy content to social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter. These third parties may use your information as described in their own privacy policies. We may share anonymous or aggregate data with others. We may use data which has been de-identified and/or aggregated for product development, research, analytics and other purposes, including for the purpose of analyzing, improving, or marketing the Khan Academy Services. In certain occasions, Khan Academy may share this data with business partners to improve our services or offerings. If we disclose information to authorized business partners to conduct research on online education or assist in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, services, promotions, and/or functionality on our Service, such data will be aggregated and/or anonymized to reasonably avoid identification of a specific individual.  Other instances where we may share or disclose information for legal or business purposes.   We will share data with employees and service providers. Khan Academy may share information with our employees and trusted vendors, third party service providers and other individuals to provide services or products for us or on our behalf, which could include analytics, hosting, marketing and similar services. When we share personal information with third party service providers or vendors, these third parties are contractually obligated to maintain the security and confidentiality of that personal information. We may share data in the context of a change of business, including a merger or acquisition. In the event that Khan Academy is involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, change of control, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets, your personal information may be transferred or disclosed in connection with such business transaction. If the transaction involves the transfer of Student Records to a third party, we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this Privacy Policy, or we will provide the School with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Records by deleting Student Records before the transfer occurs. Other instances. Khan Academy may release Personal Information if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (d) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (e) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Khan Academy, our users, or the public; or (f) as required or permitted by law. 4. Marketing and Sponsored Content Messages from Khan Academy We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services, or other third party products and services we think you may enjoy. For example, if we partner with a not-for-profit organization running a contest in your region we may send you an email notifying you of the partnership or contest. We will not share your information with the third party unless you opt-in to participate in the partnership or contest, and if so, the information we would share would be limited to that needed to facilitate your participation in the contest and enable you to redeem your prize. You can unsubscribe from these mailings at any time. See Section 6 below.  Sponsored Content Khan Academy does not display any third party advertisements on the Service. From time to time, we permit third parties to sponsor content displayed on our Service. For example, for-profit organizations may wish to sponsor all content related to a particular educational topic, such as astronomy or biology. Sponsored content will always be labeled (e.g., Sponsored by ___). Khan Academy does not share any of our users' Personal Information with these sponsors without explicit consent, and these sponsors do not have the ability to track or collect information about our site visitors or users. As a non-profit organization, Khan Academy relies on our sponsors, donors, and other contributors to provide funding necessary to provide the free Service to our users.  Please note: From time to time, we may display YouTube video content created by third parties and not by Khan Academy. While Khan Academy-created video content does not display video advertisements, third party content may include advertising which we cannot control.  5. Third Parties and Online Advertising Interest Based Advertising Khan Academy does not display any targeted advertising on our Service. However, we participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements on other websites, apps or services, including on Facebook and other social networks, or on other devices you may use. These third party ad networks use tracking technologies to recognize your browser or device and to collect information about your visit to our Service to provide you customized content, advertising and commercial messages which may be more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics and market research.  Please note that we use our best efforts and take multiple steps to avoid the collection of information for targeted advertising purposes when we believe the Service is being used by students or children under 13. For example, we take steps to inhibit these third party advertising networks from collecting information for targeted advertising purposes on webpages with child-directed content or when a student or child user logs into the Service.  To learn about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s online resources, at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices, and/or the DAA's resources at http://www.aboutads.info/choices. You may also manage certain advertising cookies by visiting the EU-based Your Online Choices at http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/. You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting limit ad tracking (iOS) or opt-out of interest based ads (Android). You may also be able to opt-out of some \u2013 but not all \u2013 interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting http://youradchoices.com/appchoices and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.  Please note that opting-out of receiving interest-based advertising through the NAI's and DAA's online resources will only opt-out a user from receiving interest-based ads on that specific browser or device, but the user may still receive interest-based ads on his or her other devices. You must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.  YouTube Khan Academy uses YouTube to display video content on the Service. YouTube incorporates tracking technologies, which may be present in the YouTube videos embedded on the Service, which may collect information from your browser when you view the video on the Service, including device identifiers and/or cookie IDs. This information is collected directly and automatically by YouTube and its partners, and Khan Academy does not participate in these data transmissions. Khan Academy does not provide any Personal Information, such as user names, to YouTube.  Khan Academy has taken steps to minimize this tracking activity, to the extent we have controls over a third-party's practices. We have turned on Privacy-Enhanced Mode for YouTube videos displayed on the Service. We also utilize Google's child-directed treatment tags to alert Google that these YouTube videos may be embedded on webpages visited by children or students. You can learn more about Google\u2019s practices at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners. You may also be able to control ad tracking through YouTube by visiting the Google Ad Settings page, currently available at: https://adssettings.google.com.  6. Your choice and options relating to data collection and use At Khan Academy, we use Personal Information as needed for the purposes for which it was collected or where you have consented to our use of your Personal Information. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we store and use is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. If you discover that Personal Information or other data pertaining to you is inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date, please update your account information or contact us as outlined below.  You can choose to not provide us with Personal Information. You may always decline to provide your Personal Information with Khan Academy. Registration is not required to access most of our online resources. If you decline to register, however, Khan Academy will not be able to provide to you certain features and functionalities found on our Service. You may later enable or access those features by providing Khan Academy with the necessary Personal Information.  You can chose to provide only information which does not reasonably identify you to others. We recommend you select a username which is not related to your actual name, for example. You can also decline to provide any optional data in your public profile.  You can disconnect us from Integrated Services. You may revoke Khan Academy's access to your account on any Integrated Service, such as Google or Facebook, at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective Integrated Service. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.  You can unsubscribe from email communications. Khan Academy may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services, or products and services we think you may enjoy. Only Khan Academy (or our vendors or service providers operating on our behalf) will send you these emails. You can choose not to receive these emails by clicking the unsubscribe link in any e-mail or via your Settings page at https://www.khanacademy.org/settings/email. Please note that you are not permitted to unsubscribe or opt-out of non-promotional messages regarding your account, such as account verification, changes or updates to features of the Service, or technical or security notices.  California Children's Privacy Rights If you are under the age of 18 residing in California, you are entitled to request removal of content or information you have posted publicly on our Service. To delete your entire account and remove all of your information displayed publicly on the Service, log into your account and select delete your account through Settings. To request deletion or de-identification of a specific question, answer or other post displayed publicly on the Service, please email us at privacy@khanacademy.org for assistance. You must be able to identify the particular post you wish to be deleted or de-identified so that we can locate it on the Service. Please note that removal of your content or information does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal, as there may be de-identified or recoverable elements of your content or information on our servers in some form. Additionally, we will not remove content or information that we may be required to retain under applicable federal and state laws.  7. How to access, update, or delete your personal information How to access or update your information. We want you to have access to your information, so that you can help keep it as accurate as possible. If you register and provide Khan Academy with Personal Information, you may update, correct, or delete your account and information at any time by reviewing your profile information and preferences on your account settings page.  Parents can modify or delete Child User accounts. Parents who request to modify or delete School User accounts may be directed to contact the School.  Khan Academy will work with Schools to provide parents access to information in School User accounts at the request and direction of the School. If you experience any difficulties in this process, please contact us as described below.  How to delete your information. To request deletion of your personal information at any time, please log into your account and select delete your account through Settings. You can learn more in our Help Center, here. Please note that your information will be retained in backup for up to one week. If you log back into your account within 24 hours, your account will not be deleted and you will need to go through the deletion process again.  We may not be able to delete data in all instances, such as information retained in technical support logs and other business records. We will not be required to delete any information which has been de-identified or disassociated with personal identifiers such that it can no longer be used to reasonably identify a particular individual.  Unless we receive a deletion request, we will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as is reasonably useful for operational purposes. For example, we may retain certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, for recordkeeping or other legitimate business purposes, or if required by law. We may also retain information which has been de-identified or aggregated such that it can no longer reasonably identify a particular individual. All retained personal information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  8. Our approach to Data Security Data security is important to you, and to us. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. For example, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information to confirm your identity, and we may require that you create and use a password to access certain parts of our Service. You should create and maintain a strong password to help ensure the security of your account.  We try to ensure that our Service and information sent to us are safe, but no security measures are perfect. Khan Academy uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the integrity and security of your Personal Information and other information we maintain in connection with our Service. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any or all of the information you transmit to Khan Academy, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Khan Academy makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or similar technologies. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and will notify you of the security incident in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  9. School Users and Student Records Khan Academy is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing free, educational content. We strive to implement best practices to protect the privacy of all of our student and non-student users, alike. To help our School partners address their obligations to protect their students data privacy, we have implemented additional controls and procedures for schools, school districts and teachers (collectively referred to as Schools) when they enter into a contract with Khan Academy to use the Service as part of the Schools educational curriculum. When the Service is used as part of the Schools educational curriculum, the personal information related to the Schools student users (School Users) that is (i) provided to Khan Academy by a student or by a School, or (ii) collected by Khan Academy during the provision of the Service to a School, may include information defined as educational records by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or other information protected by similar student data privacy laws. We call this information Student Records.  Please note, because many of our user accounts are used for both School and non-School purposes, only personal information relating to user accounts which are (1) created by a School (for example, when a teacher creates the user name, login and password to establish School User accounts, or when the teacher rosters a class using Google Classroom, Clever, or similar single sign-on service), or (2) created by a School User at the direction of a School, using a School email address and associated with a School's class on the Service, and (3) created pursuant to a contract between Khan Academy and the School, are designated as Student Records on Khan Academy. Student Records shall not include information a student or other individual may provide to Khan Academy independent of the student's use of the Service at the direction of the School. For example, if a user connects her existing Khan Academy account (i.e., an account associated with a non-School email address and created outside of her use of the Service for the School's purposes) to a School\u2019s class on the Service, the personal information and profile data associated with the account shall not be considered Student Records. If you are a School, please contact us at schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org to learn more about how to create School User accounts which may hold Student Records.  Our commitment: We are proud supporters of the Student Privacy Pledge. Our collection and use of Student Records is governed by our contracts with the Schools, by our Privacy Policy, and by applicable privacy laws. For example, we work with Schools to help protect personal information from the Students educational record, as required by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and to protect the personal information of students under 13 consistent with the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If you have any questions about reviewing, modifying, or deleting the personal information of a School User accessing the Service through a School partner agreement, please contact your School directly.  We collect, maintain, use and share Student Records only for an authorized educational and as described in our Privacy Policy, or as directed by the School, the School User and/or the student's parent or legal guardian (a Parent). We do not disclose Student Records for targeted advertising purposes. While we do permit third party advertising partners to operate on our Service for the purpose of retargeting, analytics and attribution services, we disable third party ad networks when a School User logs into a School User account on the Service. We do not build a personal profile of a School User other than in furtherance of an educational purpose or as authorized by a Parent. We maintain a comprehensive data security program designed to protect the types of Student Records maintained by the Service. We will clearly and transparently disclose our data policies and practices to our users. We will never sell Student Records unless the sale is part of a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other sale of assets, in which case we will require the new owner to continue to honor the terms provided in this Privacy Policy or we will provide the School with notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the transfer of Student Records by deleting the Student Records before the transfer occurs. We will not make any material changes to our Privacy Policy or contractual agreements that relate to the collection or use of Student Records without first giving notice to the School and providing a choice before the Student Records are used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected. How we share and disclose Student Records. We disclose Student Records in the manner described in our Privacy Policy under Section entitled How We Share and Disclose Information. Depending on the features and account controls applicable to the School User accounts, we may share usernames and profile information with other users on the Service, such as teachers, coaches, or School administrators, and this information may be visible if a School User posts content in the discussion forums.  Depending on the manner in which Khan Academy is used by a School and the terms of the agreement between the School and Khan Academy, Khan Academy may provide access to certain Student Records, School User account usage data (School Analytics) and Teacher User account usage data to the School for the purpose of monitoring student usage and activity and evaluating the effectiveness of the Schools use of the Khan Academy service. In some circumstances, School Analytics may only be available for Student accounts using a School email address or login and which are associated with a School\u2019s teacher or coach.  How we retain and delete Student Records. We will not knowingly retain Student Records beyond the time period required to support an educational purpose, unless authorized by a School, student or parent. Many of our users continue to use their accounts for a personal, non-School purpose and may associate their accounts with the account of their Parent. In such cases, the user (or the user's Parent) shall be responsible for account deletion requests.  All users, including School Users (or their Parents) can delete their accounts and all personal information associated with the account at any time through account Settings. See How can I cancel or delete my account in the Khan Academy Help Center for instructions.  The School is responsible for managing Student Records which the School no longer needs for an educational purpose by submitting a deletion request when such data is no longer needed. Schools should contact us at schoolpartnerships@khanacademy.org to request deletion of Student Records associated with the School's use of Khan Academy. Please note that Khan Academy cannot comply with a School's request to delete personal information in a user account except for School User accounts created by a School (i.e., using a School email address and/or an account login provided by a School) pursuant to a contractual agreement between the School and Khan Academy, or unless the user (or the user's Parent) requests deletion directly. We will also not be able to delete information associated with School User accounts that the School User has associated with a personal account.  Questions about Student Records. If you have questions about specific practices relating to Student Records provided to Khan Academy by a School, please direct your questions to your School.  10. How does Khan Academy protect Children's privacy? Khan Academy does not permit children under the age of 13 (a Child or Children) to create an account without the consent and at the direction of a Parent or School. Please contact us at privacy@khanacademy.org if you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 without parental consent so that we may delete the information as soon as possible.  Children under 13 may create an account with the parent's consent. Please see the Children's Privacy Policy to learn more about how Khan Academy collects, uses and shares information associated with Child accounts.  When Khan Academy is used by a School in an educational setting, we may rely on the School to provide the requisite consent for Khan Academy to collect information from a School User under the age of 13, in lieu of parental consent.  11. International Visitors Our Service is operated and managed on servers located within the United States. If you choose to use our Service from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that differ from United States law, then you acknowledge that Khan Academy will transfer your personal information to the United States for the purpose of performing the Service according to our contract (e.g., our Terms of Service) and for any other purpose for which you provide explicit, informed consent.  12. European Union Data Protection Residents in the European Union are entitled to certain rights with respect to personal information that we hold about them:  Right of access and portability. The right to obtain access to your personal information, along with certain related information, and to receive that information in a commonly used format and to have it transferred to another data controller; Right to rectification. The right to obtain rectification of your personal information without undue delay where that personal information is inaccurate or incomplete; Right to erasure. The right to obtain the erasure of your personal information without undue delay in certain circumstances, such as where the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed; Right to restriction. The right to obtain the restriction of the processing undertaken by us on your personal information in certain circumstances, such as where the accuracy of the personal information is contested by you, for a period enabling us to verify the accuracy of that personal information; and Right to object. The right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of your personal information, and to object to processing of your personal information for direct marketing purposes, to the extent it is related to such direct marketing. You may also have the right to make a complaint to the relevant Supervisory Authority. A list of Supervisory Authorities is available here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm. If you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable law. In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process personal information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.  13. Links to other sites The Service may link to and may be linked by websites operated by other entities or individuals. Some of these websites, such as the Khan Academy Facebook page, may be co-branded with our name or logo. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot always control the activities of, such other third-party websites. You should consult the respective privacy policies of those third-party websites.  14. Changes and updates to this Privacy Policy Khan Academy may modify or revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. Khan Academy will notify users of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the revised Privacy Policy with an updated date of revision on our Service. If we change this Policy in a material manner, we will do our best to notify you of the changes by posting a notice on our website. Your continued use of the Services following the effective date of such update constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy.  We will not make any material changes to our Privacy Policy that relate to the collection or use of Student Records without first giving notice to the School and providing a choice before Student Records are used in a materially different manner than was disclosed when the information was collected.  15. Contacting Khan Academy Please contact Khan Academy with any questions or comments.  By email: privacy@khanacademy.org  By mail: Khan Academy, PO Box 1630, Mountain View, CA 94042  You may also wish to visit the Khan Academy Help Center and Common Questions and Resources page, which hosts useful FAQs and information that you may find helpful.  Khan Academy Children's Privacy Policy Khan Academy is committed to children\u2019s privacy. Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to Khan Academy. For that reason, we created certain features designed to help protect personal information relating to children who are less than 13 years of age (Child Users). Khan Academy does not knowingly permit Child Users to register directly for our Service without consent of a Parent or School. If Khan Academy learns that Personal Information of a Child User has been collected on our Service without parental consent, then Khan Academy will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian (Parent) and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with our Service without your consent, please alert Khan Academy at privacy@khanacademy.org and request that we delete that child\u2019s personal information from our systems.  How children may register for and use our Service. Child Users can sign up for a Khan Academy account several ways.  1. When a Child User signs up for a Khan Academy Account we request Parental consent. When a Child User registers for our Service, we request a birthdate, username, password, and a parent's email address so that we can email the Child User's Parent in order to seek consent for the Child to use the Service. Khan Academy does not ask the Child User for any more information than is necessary to provide the Service to the Child User or to seek parental consent. The Child User is permitted to use the Service for seven (7) days through a Restricted Account (see below) while we notify the Parent for consent. If we do not receive Parental consent within 7 days, the Child User's Restricted Account is closed, and the Child's personal information is deleted from our systems.  2. When a Child User account is created by a School, the School may provide consent. When the Khan Academy Service is used by a teacher, school, or district (a School) in the classroom for an educational purpose, we permit the School to create Child User accounts and to provide the requisite consent for Khan Academy to collect personal information of a Child User for this purpose, in lieu of parental consent. Schools may create a Child User account by adding students to the Service through Google Classroom, Clever, or similar single sign-on service, or through a school integration mechanism, or a School may create logins/passwords for each individual student. When Schools create accounts in this manner, we do not request additional consent from the Parent. However, when a School or other individual invites a Child User to join the Service and connect to a teacher or coach's class using a class code, we request parental consent in the manner described below.  Methods for providing Parental consent. Parents may provide consent for a Child User to use the Service through a Restricted Account (explained below) by responding affirmatively to an email sent by Khan Academy to the Parent's email address provided by the Child User during registration. If we do not receive consent from the Parent within seven (7) days, the Child User's account will be closed and the Child's personal information is deleted from our systems. Restricted Accounts may access and use certain features of the Service in a limited manner.  To enable additional functionality for the Child User account and to enable full access and control over the Child User's account activity, the Parent must create a Parent Account on the Service and connect to the Child User's account by clicking on the account creation link in the Parental consent notice. Parent Accounts control the settings and functionality of the Child account. The Parent can maintain the Child's Restricted Account, and/or can enable additional functionality and data sharing features, if desired. Parents can revoke a Child User's permissions to use the Service at any time by deleting the account.  4. Restricted Accounts for Child Users. Khan Academy attempts to restrict a Child User's access to certain features that could result in disclosure of the Child's personal information. A Restricted Account limits sharing and displaying private information about the Child User in various ways.  For example, a Child User with a Restricted Account cannot:  display personal information other than a username. Restricted Accounts contain the Child's username and do not include other personal information or profile data. Because the username may be displayed on the Service, we strongly recommend selecting a username which does not relate to or identify the real name of the Child. The Child username can be selected or revised by the Parent by creating a Parent Account. add or edit personal information associated with a Restricted Account post to public discussion forums, or post questions or answers on lessons see or access links to third-party sites on the Service receive emails from Khan Academy (all emails are sent to the Parent email on file) communicate with or share personal information with Coaches other than a username and Service usage activity (i.e., lessons completed, badges earned, etc.). Similarly, Coaches cannot communicate with a Child User with a Restricted Account except to assign content for the Child User to view through the class. A Parent who creates a Parent Account can manage and control additional features and functionality. For example, Parents can create or revise a Child's username; add or revise profile information; restrict or enable the Child User to add a Coach using a class code. Please see How are child accounts different from regular accounts in the Help Center to learn more.  5. What information do we collect from a Child User? We collect a username, birthdate, and Parent's email address when a Child User registers for the Service, as well as any other personal information a Parent adds to a Child User's account, as described above. We collect information about the Child User's use of the Service (lessons completed, badges earned) as well as content the Child posts to the Service if such functionality is enabled by the Parent. We also collect usage and device information, as described in our Privacy Policy. We use this information to provide the Service to the Child User and for the purposes described in in our Privacy Policy's section How we use the information we collect. We use the Parent's email address to communicate messages about the account.  6. How do we disclose information relating to a Child User? As described above, Restricted Accounts have limited data sharing capabilities. A username and progress information, along with any personal information the Parent added to the Child's profile, is shared with a Coach or teacher added to the Child User's account, though a Parent Account may restrict the Child User from adding Coaches to the account. Parents may also enable additional data sharing features through a Parent Account, for example, by adding profile information and permitting the profile to be shared with Coaches and other users, or enabling the Child User to post content (e.g., questions and answers) to the Service. Parents that enable content-posting features should be aware that a Child User could post personally identifiable information in free-form content on the Service, and should monitor the Child User's posts and delete personal information if needed. We may also disclose personal information of Child Users for business purposes, as described in the Privacy Policy section Other instances where we may share or disclose information for legal or business purposes.  7. Third party tracking and online advertising. Khan Academy does not display any targeted advertising on the Service. We do not disclose personal information of Child Users for direct marketing purposes or for targeted advertising purposes. While we do permit third party advertising partners to operate on our Service for the purpose of retargeting, analytics and attribution services (See our Privacy Policy section Third Parties and Online Advertising), we take steps to disable third party ad networks on webpages with child-directed content or when a Child User logs into a Restricted Account on the Service.  YouTube Khan Academy uses YouTube to display video content on the Service. YouTube incorporates tracking technologies, which may be present in the YouTube videos embedded on the Service, which may collect information from your browser when you view the video on the Service, including device identifiers and/or cookie IDs. This information is collected directly and automatically by YouTube and its partners, and Khan Academy does not participate in these data transmissions. Khan Academy does not provide any personal information, such as usernames, to YouTube.  Khan Academy has taken steps to minimize this tracking activity, to the extent we have controls over a third-party's practices. We have turned on Privacy-Enhanced Mode for YouTube videos displayed on the Service. We also utilize Google's child-directed treatment tags to alert Google that these YouTube videos may be embedded on webpages visited by children under the age of 13. You can learn more about Google's practices at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners. You may also be able to control ad tracking through YouTube by visiting the Google Ad Settings page, currently available at: https://adssettings.google.com.  8.

Unfortunately, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure, and Pepperplate cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. As a result, while Pepperplate strives to protect a visitor's Personal Information, Pepperplate cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to us or from our online products or services, and a visitor does so at his/her own risk. Pepperplate uses the industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption when credit card information is transmitted to us.  If you contact us by email or a \"contact us\" or similar feature on our website, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view information you send by these methods in transit.  You may be able to create an account on our website with a username and password. If so, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the website by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify Pepperplate of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. It is your sole responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify Pepperplate when you desire to cancel your account on this website. We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.  We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.  In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your email address, we may notify you by email. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please email us at support@Pepperplate.com with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.  Phishing With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or online merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the email appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the website requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as \"phishing.\"  If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your website password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a Website that does not seem to be affiliated with our website, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at support@Pepperplate.com.  Consent to Processing By providing Personal Information to this website, you understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries and territories.  Changes to this Privacy Policy Pepperplate reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy, or any other of our policies or practices, at any time, and will notify users of this website by posting such changed or updated Privacy Policy on this page. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to this website. Under certain circumstances, we may also elect to notify you of changes or updates to our Privacy Policy by additional means, such as posting a notice on the front page of our website to sending you an email.", "document_id": 9}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "are my invoices safe.", "id": 2100001, "answers": [{"text": " We provide reasonable and appropriate security measures in

Privacy Policy Effective January 10, 2020. Last Revised January 10, 2020 We want you to understand how and why Reddit, Inc. (Reddit, we or us) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our websites, mobile apps, widgets, and other online products and services (collectively, the \"Services\") or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us. This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Services including Reddit Gifts, which maintains a separate privacy notice that incorporates this Privacy Policy by reference.  What We Collect Information You Provide to Us We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:  Account information. To create an account, you must provide a username and password. Your username is public, and it doesn\u2019t have to be related to your real name. You may also provide an email address. We also store your user account preferences and settings.  Content you submit. We collect the content you submit to the Services. This includes your posts and comments including saved drafts, your messages with other users (e.g., private messages, chats, and modmail), and your reports and other communications with moderators and with us. Your content may include text, links, images, gifs, and videos.  Actions you take. We collect information about the actions you take when using the Services. This includes your interactions with content, like voting, saving, hiding, and reporting. It also includes your interactions with other users, such as following, friending, and blocking. We collect your interactions with communities, like your subscriptions or moderator status.  Transactional information. If you purchase products or services from us (e.g., Reddit Gold or Reddit Ads) or sign up as a potential advertiser on Reddit Ads, we will collect certain information from you, including your name, address, email address, and information about the product or service you are purchasing. Payments are processed by third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe and PayPal), so please refer to the applicable processor\u2019s terms and privacy policy for more information about how payment information is processed and stored.  Other information. You may choose to provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, participate in Reddit-sponsored activities or promotions, apply for a job, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.  Information We Collect Automatically When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. This includes:  Log and usage data. We may log information when you access and use the Services. This may include your IP address, user-agent string, browser type, operating system, referral URLs, device information (e.g., device IDs), pages visited, links clicked, the requested URL, hardware settings, and search terms. Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete any IP addresses collected after 100 days.  Information collected from cookies and similar technologies. We may receive information from cookies, which are pieces of data your browser stores and sends back to us when making requests, and similar technologies. We use this information to improve your experience, understand user activity, personalize content and advertisements, and improve the quality of our Services. For example, we store and retrieve information about your preferred language and other settings. For more information on how you can disable cookies, please see Your Choices below.  Location information. We may receive and process information about your location. For example, with your consent, we may collect information about the specific location of your mobile device (for example, by using GPS or Bluetooth). We may also receive location information from you when you choose to share such information on our Services, including by associating your content with a location, or we may derive your approximate location from other information about you, including your IP address.  Information Collected from Other Sources We may receive information about you from other sources, including from other users and third parties, and combine that information with the other information we have about you. For example, we may receive demographic or interest information about you from third parties, including advertisers, and combine it with our own data using a common account identifier such as a hash of an email address or a mobile-device ID. You can control how we use this information to personalize the Services for you by adjusting your preferences here.  Linked services. If you authorize or link other services (e.g., third-party apps or websites) to access your Reddit account, Reddit receives information about your use of that service when it uses that authorization. Linking services may also cause the other service to send us information about your account with that service. To learn how information is shared with linked services, see How Information About You Is Shared below.  Information collected from integrations. We also may receive information about you, including log and usage data and cookie information, from third-party websites that integrate our Services, including our embeds, buttons, and advertising technology. For example, when you visit a website that uses Reddit embeds, we may receive information about the web page you visited.

For example:  When you submit content (such as a post or comment or public chat) to the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted the content. Reddit allows other websites to embed public Reddit content via our embed tools. Reddit also allows third parties to access public Reddit content via the Reddit API and via other similar technologies. Although some parts of the Services may be private or quarantined, they may become public (e.g., at the moderators option in the case of private communities) and you should take that into consideration before posting to the Services. When you send private messages, messages via modmail, or private chats, the recipients of those messages will be able to see the content of your message, your username, and the date and time the message was sent. Keep in mind that additional users may be invited to join a private chat after you send a message. Moderators may elect to have modmail forwarded to their email accounts and, as a result, any modmail received by these moderators will be subject to the terms and policies of the moderators email provider. When other users view your profile, they will be able to see information about your activities on the Services, such as your username, prior posts and comments, karma, trophies, moderator status, Reddit Gold status, and how long you have been a member of the Services. If you choose to make the information public, your profile may also include your voting history. We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media. Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter). Please note that, even when you delete your account, the posts, comments and messages you submit through the Services may still be viewable or available on our servers. For more information, see Your Choices below.  Otherwise, we do not share, sell, or give away your personal information to third parties unless one of the following circumstances applies:  With linked services. If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service. You can control this sharing as described in \"Your Choices\" below. With our partners. We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers (but not with advertisers and ad partners) who need access to such information to carry out work for us. The partners use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures. To comply with the law. We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request. Our Transparency Report has additional information about how we respond to government requests. In an emergency. We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. To enforce our policies and rights. We may share information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements, rules, or other Reddit policies, or to protect the rights, property, and safety of ourselves and others. With our affiliates. We may share information between and among Reddit, and any of our parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership. With your consent. We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction. Aggregated or de-identified information. We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were. Ads and Analytics Partners We may partner with third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and to better understand your use of the Services. These third parties may collect information sent by your computer, browser, or mobile device in response to a request for content, such as unique identifiers, your IP address, or other information about your computer or device. For example:  Advertisers and Ad Networks Our ad partners and ad networks may use cookies and related technologies to collect information when ads are delivered to you on our Services, but Reddit does not link to or provide them with your actual Reddit account details. This means that Reddit does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers. Reddit cannot see advertisers cookies and advertisers will not see Reddit cookies.  Analytics Partners We use analytics partners (such as Google Analytics) to help analyze usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services.  Your Choices As a Reddit user, you have choices about how to protect and limit the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you.  Accessing and Changing Your Information You can access and change certain information through the Services. See our Help Center page for more information. You can also request a copy of the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described here.  Deleting Your Account You may delete your account information at any time from the user preferences page. You can also submit a request to delete the personal information Reddit maintains about you by following the process described in the Other Information - Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests section below. When you delete your account, your profile is no longer visible to other users and disassociated from content you posted under that account. Please note, however, that the posts, comments, and messages you submitted prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete the specific content. We may also retain certain information about you as required by law or for legitimate business purposes after you delete your account.  Controlling Linked Services\u2019 Access to Your Account You can review the services you have linked to your account and revoke access to individual services here.  Controlling the Use of Cookies Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject first- and third-party cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.  Controlling Advertising and Analytics Some analytics providers we partner with may provide specific opt-out mechanisms and we may provide, as needed and as available, additional tools and third-party services that allow you to better understand cookies and how you can opt-out. For example, you may manage the use and collection of certain information by Google Analytics here.  We also offer you choices about receiving personalized advertisements. You can adjust how we personalize advertisements for you by visiting your ads preferences here. You may also generally opt out of receiving personalized advertisements from certain third-party advertisers and ad networks. To learn more about these advertisements or to opt out, please visit the websites of the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative, or if you are a user in the European Economic Area, Your Online Choices.  Do Not Track Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the choices described in this policy to manage the collection and use of information about you.  Controlling Promotional Communications You may opt out of receiving some or all categories of promotional communications from us by following the instructions in those communications or by updating your email options in your account preferences here. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as information about your account or your use of the Services.  Controlling Mobile Notifications With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.  Controlling Location Information If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device.  Other Information Information Security We take measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we use HTTPS while information is being transmitted. We also enforce technical and administrative access controls to limit which of our employees have access to non-public personal information.  You can help maintain the security of your account by configuring two-factor authentication.  Data Retention We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it. We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes or as required by law.  International Data Transfers We are based in the United States and we process and store information on servers located in the United States. We may store information on servers and equipment in other countries depending on a variety of factors, including the locations of our users and service providers. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights as you do under local law.  In connection with Reddit's processing of personal data received from the European Union and Switzerland, we adhere to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Program (Privacy Shield) and comply with its framework and principles.  Please direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield principles to the point of contact listed in the Contact Us section below. If we do not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to JAMS. Under certain conditions specified by the Privacy Shield principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission. If we share EU or Swiss data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party\u2019s processing of EU or Swiss data in violation of the Privacy Shield principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.  For more information about the Privacy Shield principles and to view our certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Privacy Shield website.  Additional Information for EEA Users Users in the European Economic Area have the right to request access to, rectification of, or erasure of their personal data; to data portability in certain circumstances; to request restriction of processing; to object to processing; and to withdraw consent for processing where they have previously provided consent. These rights can be exercised using the information provided under Your Choices above or using the contact information provided at the end of this document. EEA users also have the right to lodge a complaint with their local supervisory authority.  As required by applicable law, we collect and process information about individuals in the EEA only where we have legal bases for doing so. Our legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. We process your information on the following legal bases:  You have consented for us to do so for a specific purpose; We need to process the information to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services; It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as preventing fraud, ensuring network and information security, enforcing our rules and policies, protecting our legal rights and interests, research and development, and marketing and promoting the Services; We need to process your information to comply with our legal obligations. Data Subject and Consumer Information Requests Requests for a copy of the information Reddit has about your account\u2014including EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) data subject access requests and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) consumer information requests\u2014can be submitted following the process described here.  All other data subject and consumer requests under data protection laws should be sent via email to redditdatarequests@reddit.com from the email address that you have verified with your Reddit account.  Before we process a request from you about your personal information, we need to verify the request via your access to your Reddit account or to a verified email address associated with your Reddit account. You may also designate an authorized agent to exercise these rights on your behalf. Reddit does not discriminate against users for exercising their rights under data protection laws to make requests regarding their personal information.  Children Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create an account or otherwise use the Services. Additionally, if you are in the EEA, you must be over the age required by the laws of your country to create an account or otherwise use the Services, or we need to have obtained verifiable consent from your parent or legal guardian.  Changes to This Policy We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will let you know by revising the date at the top of the policy. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to r/announcements, the front page of the Services or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access or use our Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. By continuing to use our Services after Privacy Policy changes go into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised policy.

COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES We use cookies, pixel tags, and/or other similar technologies to collect visitor information.  Cookies, for example, are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser. They make it possible for us to store the contents of your shopping cart until you are ready to check out, recognize your browser when you visit and provide you with information about products that interest you. By doing this, we can personalize your return visits and save you time during checkout. It is possible to prevent cookies from being used in your browser by turning the feature off, but in order to enjoy the benefits of being a registered user, your browser must be set to accept cookies.  3. AUTHORIZED THIRD PARTIES We use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on our Sites and Apps. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Sites and Apps and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to our Sites and Apps and other sites and mobile applications to target ads for products and services. For instance, they may collect web log data from you (such as IP address and information about your browser or operating system) or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads. Through this process, demographic or other interest data may be associated with your browser or device in a non-personally identifiable manner. No personally identifiable information is collected in this process. They do not know the name, address, email address, phone number or any personally identifiable information about the user.  The NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) allows for the central opting out of all of its members' cookies from a single opt-out page. If you prefer not to receive relevant advertising on web pages, please click on the following link: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. If you delete your cookies, use a different browser or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choice.  We also work with third party service providers to monitor certain pages of our Sites and Apps for such purposes as reporting traffic and other advertising statistics. Where authorized by us, these third party providers may use cookies and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our visitors. No personally identifiable information is transferred to these third party service providers.  We may also allow third parties to provide us with analytics about your visits to our Sites and Apps. The third party analytics services may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Sites and Apps and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, and links clicked. This information is provided to us on an aggregated, non-PII basis, and may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand our users' online activity.  4. USE OF INFORMATION We use your information for the following general purposes: to fulfill your requests for products and services, administrative purposes, to improve our services, to customize the advertising and content you see, to contact you, and for internal business purposes. We use third party information you provide to us solely to provide services you specifically request.  For example, sharing your pictures electronically is one of the key benefits we offer. You are able to send an email invitation to your selected recipients, and then to allow them to view, save, or purchase products from your pictures. This email invitation contains a link created specifically for your pictures. The email also may include information about special promotional offers from our family of brands and/or carefully-screened third parties.  Another example of how we use third party information you provide to us is Shutterfly Share Sites. If you create a special site through Shutterfly Share Sites to share your pictures, you may invite recipients to participate in that site. In addition to the email invitation, these recipients will receive notifications in the form of email digests as changes are made to the site (e.g., when new content is added). As the creator of the site, you can determine the frequency of these email digests. In addition, any recipient who is a Shutterfly member can change how often he or she wishes to receive these digests through his or her account preferences.  If you use one of our referral programs to refer any of our family of brands to your friends and family, we will use their email addresses to send your invitation.  Please be assured that we do not use the email addresses that you enter through email invitations, Shutterfly Share Sites, our referrals programs, or the address books of any of our Sites and Apps to send any type of direct marketing to your friends and family. (Of course, if a friend or family member signs up with any of our family of brands or we receive their email address from another unrelated source, we may communicate with them in accordance with this Privacy Policy.)  Your accounts may also contain a calendar where you can store birthdays, anniversaries, and other key dates and details about friends and family. You can use this information to help keep in touch with friends and family on important dates. We may send you email reminders of the personalized dates you have entered in this calendar. Reminder information is highly confidential and will not be shared with any third parties.  When you add personal messages to your products, an order-processing representative may view your message.

Information We Collect As you use our websites and mobile applications or visit one of our stores, we collect information about you and the services you use. The information we collect falls into three different categories: (1) information you give us; (2) information we collect from you automatically; and (3) information we collect from other sources. Some examples of when we collect this information include when you browse one of our websites; buy or send a gift card or e-gift; or participate in a survey or promotion.

This information includes: Device and Usage Information \u2013We may collect information about your browser or device.

To collect this information, we use cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. Location Information \u2013We may collect information about the location of your device, including GPS location, for purposes of enhancing or facilitating our services, such as enabling the functionality of our websites or mobile applications that provide you with information about stores near you, enabling you to remotely order and pay for our products and services, or have certain Starbucks products delivered by a third-party vendor. We may also use information about the location of the device you are using to help us understand how our websites, mobile applications, and other services and functionality are being used and to deliver more relevant advertising. If you want to opt out of the collection of this location information, please see the section below titled \"Your Choices.\" Information We Collect from Other Sources Some information we collect is publicly available. For example, we may collect information you submit to a blog, a chat room, or a social network like Facebook, Twitter or Google+. We may also collect information about you from other companies and organizations. By gathering additional information about you, we can correct inaccurate information, enhance the security of your transactions, and give you product recommendations and special offers that are more likely to interest you. How We Use Your Information We may use the information we collect about you in a variety of ways, including to: \u2022 respond to your customer service inquiries and requests for information; \u2022 post your comments or statements on our websites; \u2022 maintain, improve, and analyze our websites, mobile applications, ads, and the products and services we offer; \u2022 detect, prevent, or investigate security breaches or fraud; \u2022 maintain appropriate records for internal administrative purposes; \u2022 facilitate the functionality of our websites and mobile applications; How We Share Your Information We may share your information in the following circumstances: When We Work Together  We may share information between and among Starbucks Corporation, its subsidiaries, and affiliated companies for purposes of management and analysis, decision making, and other business purposes. For example, we may share your information with our subsidiaries and affiliated companies to administer our loyalty programs, process orders and requests, and expand and promote our product and service offerings. When We Work with Service Providers  We may share your information with service providers that provide us with support services, such as credit card processing, website hosting, email and postal delivery, location mapping, product and service delivery, analytics services, or conducting academic research. When We Work on Business Transactions  If we become involved with a merger or another situation involving the transfer of some or all of our business assets, we may share your information with business entities or people involved in the negotiation or transfer. When Sharing Helps Us Protect Lawful Interests  We may disclose your information if we believe that the disclosure is required by law, if we believe that the disclosure is necessary to enforce our agreements or policies, or if we believe that the disclosure will help us protect the rights, property, or safety of Starbucks or our customers or partners. When We Work with Marketing Service Providers  We may share your information with marketing service providers to assess, develop and provide you with promotions and special offers that may interest you, administer contests, sweepstakes and events or for other promotional purposes. When You Give Consent  We may share information about you with other companies if you give us permission or direct us to share the information. When the Information Does Not Identify You \u2013 We may share your information in a way that does not directly identify you. For example, we may share information about your use of our websites and mobile applications in a manner that does not identify you or may combine information about the nature or frequency of your transactions with similar information about other people and share the aggregated information for statistical analysis and other business purposes. How We May Allow Others to Collect Your Information When you use our websites or mobile applications, we may allow third parties to collect device and usage information and location information across your different devices through mobile software development kits, cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. These third parties collect this information for the following purposes and for other purposes consistent with their own privacy policies: To Display Ads for Products or Services  We allow some advertising companies to collect this information in order to display ads that are most relevant to you across your different devices and on our own and others websites and mobile apps. Please see the \"Your Choices\" section of this Statement for more information about opting out of targeted advertising and controlling the use of cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. To Understand the Use of Our Services  We allow certain service providers to collect this information to help us understand how our websites and mobile applications are used and to assist us in improving the content and operation of our online properties. These service providers collect aggregate statistical usage data that is not matched or linked to any individual user.  To Link Your Activity on Our Websites to Your Social Networks  We have added certain features to our websites and mobile applications that allow social networks (such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+) to track the activities of their members or collect certain information when they use our website or mobile applications. These features may include technologies called plug-ins and widgets. Plug-ins create a direct link between two websites, and widgets are interactive mini-programs that provide other companies\u2019 services on our websites. If you are concerned about the way a social network is tracking your activity, please contact the social network or review its privacy policy. For example, you can review Facebook\u2019s data-use policy at https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/.  To Make the Services of Other Companies Work on Our Websites  We allow companies to use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies to enhance the operations of particular services and functionality of our websites and mobile applications. For example, we may allow Adobe to set and enable special cookies that are necessary to deliver video content for Adobe Flash Player. These cookies are called Flash cookies. Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies We and others may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our websites and mobile applications. These technologies include cookies, web beacons, java scripts, entity tags, and HTML local storage. Most web browsers can be programmed to accept or reject the use of some or all of these technologies, although you must take additional steps to disable or control other technologies. For more information, please see the section of this Statement titled \"Your Choices\" Cookies \u2013 Cookies are small data files that are sent from a websites server and are stored on your devices hard drive either for only the duration of your visit (\"session cookies\") or for a fixed period (\"persistent cookies\"). Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server. Web Beacons  Web beacons are small, transparent images that are embedded in web pages, applications, and emails that are sometimes called clear gifs,\" single pixel gifs\", \"page tags\" or web bugs.\" We use web beacons to track the web pages you visit, to test the effectiveness of our marketing, and to find out if an email has been opened and acted on. Java Scripts  Java scripts are code snippets embedded in various parts of websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components. Entity Tags -- Entity Tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or \"cached\" within your browser and validates these caches when the website is opened, accelerating website performance since the web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed. HTML5 Local Storage  HTML5 local storage allows data from websites to be stored or \"cached\" within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited. These and similar technologies are used for the following purposes: Services and Functionality \u2013 Some of these technologies are required to allow you to access and use our websites or mobile applications and the various services and functionality we offer. Without these technologies, some of the services and functionality on our websites and mobile applications would not work properly. Performance Monitoring \u2013 Some of these technologies help us analyze and estimate traffic and assess the volume of use of services and functionality on websites and mobile applications. They show us how visitors and customers interact with our digital properties, whether there are any errors, the degree to which certain web pages, applications, services or functionality are accessed and used and how they are performing or operating. When these technologies are used for performance monitoring, no information that identifies you is collected. User Convenience \u2013 Some of these technologies enhance the ease of use of our websites and mobile applications and the services and functionality they make available by accelerating load and refresh times and remembering information that you have provided on prior visits to our websites or when you last used a website or mobile application service or functionality. Marketing \u2013 Some of these technologies are used to tailor your experience on our website, within our mobile applications, or across your applications or devices by controlling the promotions, advertisements and other marketing messages that may appear when you access or use these or other digital properties. These technologies also help us learn which services and functionality you are using and how you are accessing information about us. We may use this information to personalize your visit to a website or use of a mobile application or to send you relevant promotions and advertisements. Your Choices Promotional Communication Choices Location Information You may be able to adjust the settings of your device so that information about your physical location is not sent to us or third parties by (a) disabling location services within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access location information by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device or browser settings. Please note that your location may be derived from your WiFi, Bluetooth, and other device settings. See your device settings for more information. Voice Transmissions You can ensure you do not send us or any third parties any transmissions of your voice by not using the voice ordering feature. In addition, you may be able to adjust the settings of your device so that your voice transmissions cannot be sent to us or third parties by (a) disabling microphone and speech recognition services within the device settings; or (b) denying certain websites or mobile applications permission to access microphone and speech recognition services by changing the relevant preferences and permissions in your mobile device or browser settings. Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies \u2013 You may be able to reject cookies, web beacons, entity tags and HTML5 local storage by adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser. Each browser is different, but many common browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) have preferences or options that may be adjusted to allow you to either accept or reject cookies and certain other technologies before they are set or installed or allow you to remove or reject the use or installation of certain technologies altogether. If you want to learn the correct way to modify your browser settings, please use the Help menu in your browser. Interest-Based Ads -- Many advertising companies that collect information for interest-based advertising are members of the Digital Advertising Alliance or the Network Advertising Initiative, both of which maintain websites where people can opt out of interest-based advertising from their members. To opt-out on these pages, visit www.AboutAds.info and www.networkadvertising.org. Adobe Flash Player Technology \u2013 We allow Adobe to set and enable special cookies that are necessary to deliver video content for Adobe Flash Player. You cannot remove Flash cookies simply by changing your browser settings. If you would like to limit the websites that can store information in Flash cookies on your device, you must visit the Adobe website: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html. \"Do Not Track\" Technology \u2013 Some newer web browsers have a \"Do Not Track\" preference that transmits a \"Do Not Track\" header to the websites you visit with information indicating that you do not want your activity to be tracked. We currently do not respond to browser \"Do Not Track\" signals. How We Protect Your Information Starbucks protects your information using technical, physical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of your information. When you transmit highly sensitive information (such as a credit card number) through our website or in one of our mobile applications, we encrypt the transmission of that information using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. While we have employed security technologies and procedures to assist safeguarding your personal information, no system or network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Use by Children We do not intend for our websites or online services to be used by anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we may have collected information about your child, please contact us as described in the \"Contact Us\" section of this Statement.

We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you (\"personal information\"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, user name and password, and billing information (such as your credit card number, cardholder name, and card expiration date). We may also request information about your travel plans, style, and preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and flight class, luggage, and ticketing options. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to receive relevant offerings from TripAdvisor and its partners and enjoy other benefits of being a registered member. For example, only registered members are able to post travel reviews, participate in discussion forums, email TripAdvisor content to themselves and others, access members-only newsletters and travel planning content, and enter surveys, contests, or sweepstakes. In addition, some information is also required in order for you to ask us a question or initiate other transactions on our site.  Information About Others. You will have the opportunity to provide contact and travel-related information for other people through our Website. If you make a reservation for someone else through TripAdvisor, you will need to submit that individuals personal information. You must obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information, as any access to view or modify their information will be available only through your account.  Information from Other Sources. We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit TripAdvisor by clicking through from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us, such as contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third party services, such as social media services, through our Website or before coming to our Website, we may collect information such as your user name, password, and other information made available to us through those services. We will work with our existing partners and potential future partners to improve and personalize your use of our Website in accordance with the practices outlined in this section and Policy.  We have partnered with Facebook to provide personalized content on TripAdvisor for members of Facebook. If you are logged into Facebook and TripAdvisor, TripAdvisor will be personalized for you when you visit the Website, even if you are a first-time user of TripAdvisors Website. For example, we will show you reviews that your Facebook friends have posted on TripAdvisor and places they have visited. In order to provide you with this personalized experience, Facebook provides us with information that you have chosen to make available pursuant to your Facebook privacy settings. That information may include your name, profile picture, gender, friend lists and any other information you have chosen to make available.  If you decide to turn off personalization, you can do so by first logging into Facebook and (1) selecting Edit your profile from the Your TripAdvisor drop-down menu on the Member Profile page and clicking Disconnect in the Facebook Connect status box, or (2) selecting Connected accounts from the Your TripAdvisor drop-down menu on the Member Profile page and clicking Disconnect under Facebook Settings. You can also turn off personalization by editing your app settings on Facebook. Please note that if you have Facebook friends who are using TripAdvisor, they may also have shared information about you with us through Facebook. If you wish to prevent that sharing, you can do so by editing your Facebook privacy settings.  Automatic Information. We automatically collect some information from your computer or Device when you visit TripAdvisor. For example, we will collect session data, including your IP address, Web browser software, and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as content viewed, pages visited, and searches and/or reservations facilitated or made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests and preferences of our users and customize your user experience.  Payment Information. If you make travel reservations with third-party suppliers facilitated by TripAdvisor, we will collect payment information from you, including your credit card number, cardholder name, expiration date, authentication code, and billing address. We will securely transmit this information to the supplier of the travel reservation to complete the transaction. Please note that the supplier processes your payment, not TripAdvisor, unless otherwise specified. You agree to review and be bound by the suppliers policies and procedures before making a reservation through TripAdvisor.  Location Information and Other Information from Devices. When you use an Application on a Device, we will collect and use information about you in generally similar ways and for similar purposes as when you use the TripAdvisor website. In addition, we may collect information about your location if you have instructed your Device to send such information to the Application via the privacy settings on that Device, or if you have uploaded photos tagged with location information. We may use the location information collected from your Device or photos to enhance your use of the Application by providing you with relevant content and contextual advertising. For example, we may use your location to show you reviews of hotels or restaurants near you when you are traveling. You can change the privacy settings of your Device at any time, in order to turn off the functionality to share location information with the Application and/or the functionality to tag your photos with location information. Please note that turning off location sharing may affect certain features of our App. If you have any queries about the privacy settings of your Device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your Device or your mobile service provider for help.  Cookies and Other Web Technologies. Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computers hard drive or your Device (if your Web browser permits). TripAdvisor, its affiliated websites, and Apps use cookies for the following general purposes:  To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while your browser was visiting our site. For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit. We also may record your password in a cookie, if you checked the box entitled \"Save this password for automatic sign-in.\" Please note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. To help us customize the content, experience, and advertisements provided to you on our websites and Apps and on other websites across the Internet. For example, when you access a web page, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests. See Display of Advertising/Your Choices for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices. To help measure and research the effectiveness of features and offerings, advertisements, and email communications (by determining which emails you open and act upon). The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers should tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable most types of cookies. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered on our sites.  Our sites also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.  Display of Advertising/Your Choices. Data collected to serve you with relevant advertising  TripAdvisor and its affiliated websites are committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites. To do this, we may collect information about your travel-related searches and other site activities, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads on our sites or elsewhere online that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a flight to Florida on TripAdvisor, you may see an ad for a Florida travel package on TripAdvisor or on another website you visit.  We do not share your personal information (such as email addresses) with unaffiliated third parties so they can serve you with advertisements. You can choose not to receive relevant online advertising on other websites, based on your travel-related searches on TripAdvisor by clicking here.  Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising  Many of the advertisements you see on the TripAdvisor family of sites are served by TripAdvisor or its service providers. But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites, and (2) advertising networks, who collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.  Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please click here.  Response to Do Not Track signals  Your web browser may transmit a Do Not Track (DNT) signal to TripAdvisor and other websites. Because of differences in web browsers default settings and the manner in which browsers incorporate DNT signals, it is sometimes unclear to site operators whether site visitors have selected the DNT setting themselves, or whether they are aware that they have a choice in determining the setting. TripAdvisor does not currently respond to DNT signals. Once the Internet industry has settled on standards related to this issue and TripAdvisor recognizes such standards, we may reevaluate this approach.     How we use your information TripAdvisor uses the information we collect about you for the following general purposes: for registration and to manage your account, including to allow your access to and use of our site; to communicate with you in general, including to provide information about TripAdvisor and invitations from the TripAdvisor community; to enable us to publish your reviews, forum posts, and other content to the TripAdvisor community; to facilitate your booking of travel reservations; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and Website; to notify you about special offers and products or services available from us or our partners that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with TripAdvisor, including customizing the ads shown to you; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.  If you have signed up as the owner or manager of a vacation rental, or listed your vacation rental property in our Destination Resources section, we will send you email messages at the email address you provide to us.  Please review \"Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information\" below.     With whom we share your information TripAdvisor may share your information with the following entities:  Suppliers,including but not limited to hotel, airline, cruise, car rental, or activity providers, or vacation rental managers or owners who fulfill your travel reservations. Throughout TripAdvisor and its affiliated sites, all products and services provided by third-party suppliers are described as such. Information that we share with suppliers to facilitate reservations will be treated according to applicable suppliers privacy policies, except for payment information. We share payment information only when it is necessary for travel reservations facilitated through or made on TripAdvisor, and we restrict suppliers use of payment information for these purposes. We encourage you to review the privacy policies, terms of use, and other policies of any travel supplier whose products and services you may purchase through TripAdvisor. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you or your travel plans, to facilitate your travel reservations, or for other purposes consistent with the practices described in their privacy policies and terms of use. Third-party vendors who provide services or functions on our behalf, including business analytics, payment processing, customer service, marketing, public relations, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including, for example, as necessary to operate features of our Website or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose. Business partners with whom we may offer products or services in conjunction. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear either with ours or separately. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners. Referring Websites. If you were referred to TripAdvisor from another website, we may share your registration information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number and travel preferences, about you with that referring website. We have not placed limitations on the referring websites use of personal information and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you to TripAdvisor. Social Media Services. You can choose to access certain third party social media websites and services through our site (such as Facebook). When you do so, you are sharing information with those sites, and the information you share will be governed by their privacy policies. You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these third party social media websites. Companies within our corporate family. We may share your personal information within the TripAdvisor Media Group, as well as with our parent companies and domestic and international corporate affiliate companies and websites. This sharing enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you. To the extent that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email messages in the future. We also may share your information if we believe, in our sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary\u2026  To comply with legitimate and enforceable subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of TripAdvisor, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements. In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. If you choose to create a profile on TripAdvisor, certain information in your profile will be publicly viewable and identifiable via your screen name. You will have the ability to view your profile as members of the public will see it. Additionally, if you choose to participate in our member-to-member communications programs, other TripAdvisor members may contact you by using TripAdvisor as an intermediary; however, TripAdvisor will not share your email address with any other members nor display it any public manner. All TripAdvisor members have the option to turn off the member-to-member communication features at any time.  Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share such information.  We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our Website receives or the most popular hotels and vacation destinations. This information does not contain any personal information and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.     How you can access your information We take reasonable steps to ensure that your information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, and complete. You can access and update your contact information by visiting the Member Profile page on the TripAdvisor Website. You can close your TripAdvisor account by contacting us using this form. We will send you an email to confirm your request. Please note that after you close an account, you will not be able to sign in or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new account at any time. Please also note that we may retain certain information associated with your account in our archives, including for analytical purposes as well as for recordkeeping integrity.     Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information As discussed above, you can choose not to provide us with any information, although it may be needed to take advantage of certain features offered on TripAdvisor. You also can add or update information and close your account as described above. If you decide to close your TripAdvisor account, we will deactivate your account and remove your profile information from active view. Please note, however, that we may retain in our files some information associated with your account and past transactions for purposes including backups, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, investigations, and compliance with legal requirements. As a registered TripAdvisor member, you can modify your email subscription choices at any time on the Member Profile page. Whether registered as a TripAdvisor member or not, you also will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from promotional messages in any such email we send. Please note that we reserve the right to send you other communications, including service announcements, administrative messages, and surveys relating either to your TripAdvisor account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Email Communications. TripAdvisor wants to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our Website. One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your apparent travel-related interests. For example, if you search for a flight to New York, or New York hotels or reviews on TripAdvisor, we may send you an email message reminding you about special airfare or hotel offers in New York. Similarly, if you receive an email about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels, flights, or local travel reviews by affirmatively clicking on a link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel or flight offers. We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our sites. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from TripAdvisor, you will not be able to access portions of our site.    How we protect your information We want you to feel confident about using TripAdvisor, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no website can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your personal information between your system and ours, and between our system and those of the parties with whom we share sensitive information, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.     Children's privacy TripAdvisor is a general audience site and does not offer services directed to children. Should an individual whom we know to be a child under age 13 send personal information to us, we will delete or destroy such information as soon as reasonably possible.

Uses For over two centuries, the Postal Service\u2122 has valued your privacy, and built a brand that customers trust. Thank you for reviewing our privacy policy.  Our privacy policy tells you about our information practices when you provide personal information to us, whether collected online or offline, or when you visit us online to browse, obtain information, or conduct a transaction. Personal information may include your name, email, mailing and/or business address, phone numbers, or other information that identifies you personally. We do not require you to register or provide personal information to visit our website.  Key aspects of our privacy policy include:  We do not sell or rent your personal information to outside parties. We do not market other products or services to you without your consent. We do not use web analysis tools (e.g., cookies) to identify you personally without your express consent. The policy includes detailed explanations of how we provide:   The following describes the ways we collect information from you, and the protections that apply to your information.  The Postal Service collects personal information from you and from your transactions with us. We use information we collect to provide you certain products and services, and if needed to respond to your inquiries or requests for information. We occasionally collect data about you from financial entities to perform verification services and from commercial sources. We do this, for example, to prepopulate data fields in call centers to facilitate transactions, or to market products to consumers who have agreed to receive such messages.  Privacy Act Rights The Postal Service follows the privacy requirements of the Privacy Act, which protects your personal information that we maintain in what is called a system of records. A system of records is a file, database, or program from which personal information is retrieved by name or other personal identifier. In other words, the Privacy Act applies when we use your personal information to know who you are and to interact with you  such as when you provide information to request a product or service, register on usps.com, or submit an inquiry or complaint. The Privacy Act provides comprehensive protections for your personal information. This includes how information is collected, used, disclosed, stored, and discarded.  When we collect and maintain personal information from you offline, a Privacy Act notice will be provided. The following is your Privacy Act notice for personal information collected online:  Privacy Act notice: Your information will be used to provide you requested products, services, or information. Collection is authorized by 39 USC 401, 403, & 404. Providing the information is voluntary, but if not provided, we may not process your transaction. We do not disclose your information to third parties without your consent, except to facilitate the transaction, to act on your behalf or request, or as legally required. This includes the following limited circumstances: to a congressional office on your behalf; to financial entities regarding financial transaction issues; to a USPS auditor; to entities, including law enforcement, as required by law or in legal proceedings; to domestic and international customs relating to outgoing international mail pursuant to federal law and agreements; and to contractors and other entities aiding us to fulfill the service (service providers).  Click below for more information on Privacy Act protections.  USPS Handbook AS-353, Guide to Privacy and Freedom of Information Act, and Records Management  Information Collected from Emails and Online Forms Many of our programs and websites allow you to send us an email. We will use the information you provide to respond to your inquiry, provide information, or to fill your order for postal products and services in which you have expressed an interest.  Remember that email may not necessarily be secure against interception. If your email communication is very sensitive, or includes information such as your bank account, charge card, or social security number, you should send it by mail unless the Web site indicates the particular site is secured.  The Postal Service believes in permission-based marketing. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personal information to outside marketers. You will only receive marketing about products and services of the Postal Service or its partners, other than products and services you already receive or are registered for, under the following conditions.  If you are a consumer, we use an opt-in standard. If you have provided personal information to register for or purchase a product or service, we will not use that information to contact you in the future about another product or service unless you have provided express consent. If you are a business, we use an opt-out standard. We assume you are interested in other products and services that could aid you in your business, and so we will provide information to you unless you tell us you do not want to receive it. Consumers may opt-in, and businesses may opt-out, when they register on usps.com and create a customer profile. These preferences in the profile can be changed at any time. Please contact the privacy office at the addresses below with any questions about your preferences.  Security In those instances where we secure your personal information in transit to us and upon receipt, the Postal Service uses the industry standard encryption software, Secured Socket Layer (SSL). The URL in your browser will change to \"HTTPS\" instead of \"HTTP\" when this security feature is invoked. Your browser may also display a lock symbol on its bottom task bar line to indicate this secure transmission is in place.  For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, the Postal Service employs software programs to monitor network traffic in order to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits other than those uses identified in this policy. Unauthorized modification or misuse of information stored in this system will be investigated and may result in criminal prosecution.  U.S. Postal Service information systems may be protected by EINSTEIN cybersecurity capabilities, under the operational control of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). Electronic communications with the Postal Service may be scanned by government-owned or contractor equipment to look for network traffic indicating known or suspected malicious cyber activity, including malicious content or communications. Electronic communications within the Postal Service will be collected or retained by US-CERT only if they are associated with known or suspected cyber threats. US-CERT will use the information collected through EINSTEIN to analyze the known or suspected cyber threat and help the Postal Service and other agencies respond and better protect their computers and networks.  For additional information about EINSTEIN capabilities, please see the EINSTEIN program-related Privacy Impact Assessments available on the DHS cybersecurity privacy website http://www.dhs.gov/files/publications/editorial_0514.shtm#4, along with other information about the federal government's cybersecurity activities.  Service Providers The Postal Service enters into relationships with service providers in order to provide the highest quality product or service. Service providers may include an entity that provides assistance for the program, such as a call center; a provider of advertising services; or a partner for the program. The USPS holds service providers to the same rigorous standards of privacy that apply to the USPS, including being made subject to the Privacy Act and USPS privacy policies. Service providers that have access to personal information are also subject to security review.  If you have provided personal information to us, you may request to review the information that we have maintained. Please contact the program office that provided you the product or service, the office that handled your inquiry, or the privacy office at the addresses below. We will correct or delete any inaccurate information upon your request.  We would like to hear from you if you have any questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or use of your information.  Please contact us at privacy@usps.gov, or mail us at:  PRIVACY OFFICE US POSTAL SERVICE 475 L'ENFANT PLZ SW RM 9431 WASHINGTON DC 20260-1101 We will investigate and respond to your inquiry. Your inquiry will be treated confidentially and will be protected under the Privacy Act.  Information Collected and Stored Automatically We automatically collect certain information about your visit to usps.com. We limit the data collected to meet specific business needs and to fully protect your privacy. We thus may know what path(s) you took on usps.com, but we don't know who you are. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not use this information to identify you personally without your express consent.  We automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:  General log information\u2014Internet domain (for example, \"xcompany.com\" or \"yourschool.edu\"); Internet Protocol (IP) address; operating system; the browser used to access our Web site; the date and time you access our site; and the pages that you visited. Additionally, we collect information that identifies the software acting on your behalf (i.e., your user agent) and the device that you are using if you access the site through a mobile or wireless network. We use the information to help us make usps.com more useful to visitors. We use it to learn about how locations on our site are being used, what information is of most and least interest, and to ensure usps.com can interface with the types of technology our visitors use. We also use the information to tell us of any possible site performance problems and to identify, prevent, or mitigate the effects of fraudulent transactions.  Referral and statistical information where we have links or ad banners to or from usps.com. Such data may include aggregate data such as the number of click-throughs that occurred. It may also include specific data, such as whether you are a repeat visitor; whether you visited a page with a banner on it or clicked on an ad banner and then used our site (for instance, to register or make a purchase); the value, date and time of any sale; and the identity of the site which you linked to or from usps.com. We collect this information to know which links and banners are effective. For example, this allows us to determine which ads may be of most interest and to help us control how many times a specific ad is displayed.  How Data Is Collected - Cookies and Other Web Analysis Tools We understand that you may have questions about Web technology and information that is collected as you surf or conduct business online. The Postal Service has very strict policies about Web analysis tools. Such tools include what are known as cookies and Web beacons.  The Postal Service uses a third-party analytics provider (currently Google Analytics Premium) to analyze data from cookies. The third-party analytics provider does not receive personally identifiable information through these cookies and is prohibited from combining, matching or cross-referencing usps.com information with any other information. We have also limited the provider's ability to see your full IP address (a process known as \"IP masking\"). Please refer to Google Analytics security and privacy principles for more information.  The Postal Service strictly limits the types of analysis tools allowed, the data collected, and how long the tools last, in order to best serve your business needs and also safeguard your privacy. The types of Web analysis tools we use are fully explained below, and in the attached letter from the Postmaster General.  Postmaster General's Letter on Cookie Usage PDF | HTM  Cookies Cookies may be categorized as session or persistent, which describes the length of time that they stay on your system. Both session and persistent cookies are used on this site. The following are detailed descriptions of how we use these cookies.  Session Cookies A session cookie is a small piece of textual information that a server places temporarily on your browser during the time your browser is open. The cookies are erased once you close all browsers. We use session cookies in the following manner:  Log-on and log-off administration\u2014If you decide to register with our site, so as, for example, to use one of our online services, session cookies help with the log-on and log-off process. The cookies enable us to recognize your log-on ID when you log on so that we do not establish a duplicate registration record for you.  Transactions and site usability \u2014 We use session cookies to improve how you navigate through usps.com and conduct transactions. As examples, session cookies are used to maintain your online session as you browse over several pages; to store and prepopulate information so that you do not have to reenter the same information twice; to enable the postage rate calculator; and to retain your shopping cart information. Session cookies may also be used to collect referral statistics when you click on a link or ad banner to or from usps.com.  Persistent Cookies A persistent cookie is a small piece of text stored on your computer's hard drive for a defined period of time, after which the cookie is erased. We do not collect or link to personal information through persistent cookies without your express consent. We use persistent cookies as follows:  Site usage measurement\u2014Our site measurement tool uses a persistent cookie to assist us in measuring how and when our Web site and its various components are used. It functions as a \"visit cookie,\" so that we can determine if you are a repeat visitor to our site. This allows us to know if we are attracting new visitors and what aspects of the site seem most useful. The cookie will expire 30 days after your last visit.  Log-off safety function\u2014The USPS uses a persistent cookie to automatically log you off of usps.com if there has been no activity for 15 minutes. This is done for your safety to ensure that, if you have finished using our site, but have forgotten to log off, no one else can use your computer via your log-on and password. The cookie is permanently removed from your computer when you log off, or, if you have closed the browser without logging off, it is removed within 15 minutes from your last activity.  Opt-in cookies\u2014Persistent cookies allow us, at your request, to recognize you when you return to usps.com, or to remember certain information that you have provided us. The recognition feature allows you to log on to usps.com automatically, without having to enter your name and password each visit. The cookie assigns a random number to you, which we link to personal information you have provided and your purchase history. This allows us to personalize the site for you and tailor the content to your needs, for instance to show you other products you may be interested in. Other cookies allow us to remember certain information related to prior transactions, such as package tracking numbers, or mailing or address lists, so that we may prepopulate those fields for you on return visits. These features and cookies are strictly at your option and for your convenience. We will also present you with a convenient way to remove the cookies, via where you manage your account, if you decide later that you want to terminate one or more of these functions. The cookies will expire one year from your last visit.  Ad banner cookies\u2014On behalf of the USPS, persistent cookies and beacons (described below) may be set and managed by third party advertising suppliers to support ad banners. Ad banner cookies are set when you view or click on an ad banner on usps.com, or an ad banner on another site for a USPS product, and persist for no more than five years.  Web Beacons A Web beacon, also referred to as a clear gif or page tag, consists of code on the USPS site that delivers a small graphic image from another Web site or third party server. They may not be visible as the beacon is generally a 1x1 pixel that is often designed to blend into the background of a Web page.  We use beacons, often in conjunction with cookies, to monitor the effectiveness of ad banners; and to gather general log, statistical, and referral information. We do not use beacons to store or link to personal information. We thus use beacons to understand certain actions that you took (such as a purchase), but not to know who you are.  Third Party Web Analysis Tools The Postal Service does not allow Web analysis tools to be used by third parties, except for service providers who help us in performing site analysis or providing a particular product, service, or advertisement. Service providers may use session cookies, just like the USPS does, solely to improve the use of the site. Service providers may only use persistent cookies and beacons if specifically approved by the USPS, which uses must comply fully with this policy.  Data Derived from Web Analysis Tools We are careful to safeguard any data derived from cookies and beacons. No data derived from session cookies, or from the log-off persistent cookie, are retained. Data derived from other persistent cookies and beacons are retained behind the USPS firewall or a secure firewall of our service provider.  Opting Out of Web Analysis Tools If you still have concerns about cookies, you may choose to opt out of their use.  Ad banner cookies  You can opt out of ad banner cookies, without erasing or altering other cookies. If you opt out of these cookies, we will no longer track any information from ad banners related to a specific user's visit. By clicking below, you will be taken to a third party site that explains how to opt out.  Click here to learn how to opt out of ad banner cookie.  Opting out of all cookies  You may choose to opt out of the use of all cookies. You will still be able to access most features of usps.com. However, certain features may not work as well or may be unavailable to you. You will not be able to register or purchase from usps.com because we need cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to process your transaction.  Click here to learn how to opt out of all cookies.  Information from Children From time to time as part of a special Postal Service promotion, such as stamp collecting, we may request information from children under 13 years of age. We will do so only with parental notice and consent. We will take all necessary steps to protect the privacy and safety of any child participating, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  Postal Service Collection of Information from Children We will post a notice that we are requesting information from children including the type of information, how we will use it, whether it will be forwarded to a third party, and a contact at our Web site for questions. We will utilize the information only for the given Postal Service promotion. We will not condition a child's participation in an event on the provision of more information than is absolutely necessary for that promotion. An example of such a promotion could be a stamp-collecting program that might be of interest to children.  Obtaining Verifiable Parental Consent We will use reasonable effort to obtain verifiable parental consent prior to the collection and use of personally identifiable information from children under 13. The method of parental consent verification may vary according to the event in which the child wishes to participate. Means of obtaining such consent may include, but are not limited to, offline consent such as printing and submitting a permission form by mail or fax, or online consent that contains a verifiable unique identifier such as a credit card.  Parental Review The U.S. Postal Service will allow parents to review any personal information collected from their children, based on verifying the identity of the consenting parent. Parents may revoke their consent and delete information collected from their children at their discretion. The Postal Service will then stop collecting, using, or disclosing information from that child, and will end that child's participation in that event if such information is necessary to continue. We will also alert parents if the event or activity changes either the type of information collected or the way in which the site uses the information.  When Parental Consent is Not Required We do not require parental consent in order to collect and use online contact information to:  respond directly to a child's request on a one-time basis to a specific request where the information is not used to recontact the child for other purposes;  request the name or online contact information of a parent for the sole purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or providing parental notification;  respond more than once directly to a specific request from a child and not used to recontact the child beyond the scope of that request.  Notification to Children The U.S. Postal Service will provide a prominent notice to children describing in age appropriate terms what personally identifiable information will be collected, and explain the need for those children to obtain parental consent before sharing their information.", "document_id": 18}]}, {"paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "do people know if i disable the breaking news

For example, materials that you have posted may be republished or reposted by another user or third party.  Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit do-not-track signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals. In the meantime, please see Online Tracking & Advertising for additional information about privacy choices that may be available to you with respect to targeted advertising.  International Transfers. The Services are headquartered in the United States. Please be aware that information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Services may be collected in your country and subsequently transferred to the United States or to another country in accordance with applicable law.

We will notify you of changes by posting changes here, or by other appropriate means. Any changes to the Privacy Policy will become effective when the updated policy is posted on the Services. Your use of the Services or your provision of personal information to use the Services following such changes indicates your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.  Online Tracking & Advertising  How We Use Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies and How To Disable These Technologies  We and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality or measure and analyze ad performance on our Services, may use cookies, web beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and navigation on the Site, to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and/or improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience.  Cookies. Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:  Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience. Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you dont receive the same ad each time you access a Service. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.  Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or pixels) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.  Local Storage & Other Tracking Technologies. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as Flash cookies) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. We also may use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found here.  Additional Choices With Respect To Targeted Advertising  As described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to facilitate serving relevant ads to you. For example, these technologies help us determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can learn more about certain types of targeted advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices page.  In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance .   Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.  Please visit our Ad Choices page for additional information and privacy choices.
